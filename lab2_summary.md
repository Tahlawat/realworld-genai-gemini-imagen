## 🧪 Lab 2: Build an AI Image Generator App Using Imagen on Vertex AI

### 📚 Overview

This lab introduces you to creating AI-generated images using Google's **Imagen 3.0 model** via **Vertex AI**. By the end of this lab, you'll know how to take a **natural language prompt** and turn it into a visually compelling AI-generated image—all programmatically.

---

### 🎯 Objectives

- Connect to Vertex AI using the Python SDK.
- Load a pre-trained image generation model: `imagen-3.0-generate-002`.
- Send a natural language **text prompt** to the model.
- Receive and **save the generated image** locally.
- Learn foundational steps in building AI-based applications.

---

### 🛠️ What You Built

1. **Vertex AI Connection**
   - Initialized Vertex AI using `vertexai.init()` with project ID and location.
   - Ensured the environment was ready to use Vertex's powerful generative services.

2. **Load Imagen 3.0**
   - Used `ImageGenerationModel.from_pretrained("imagen-3.0-generate-002")` to access a ready-to-use generative image model.

3. **Text-to-Image Generation**
   - Generated an image using a descriptive prompt like:  
     `"Create an image of a cricket ground in the heart of Los Angeles"`

4. **Image Handling**
   - Saved the AI-generated image to the local environment using `images[0].save(location=output_file)`.

|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Imagen 3.0 Model           | Google's state-of-the-art model that converts text prompts into images.    |
| Vertex AI SDK              | A Python interface to interact with Google's AI services.                  |
| Prompt Engineering         | Writing precise text descriptions helps generate better visual outcomes.   |
| Deterministic Generation   | By setting a seed, output images can be reproduced consistently.           |
| Watermark Handling         | The optional `add_watermark=False` disables SynthID watermarking.          |

### 💡 Insights & Takeaways

- Imagen 3.0 can generate **highly detailed and context-rich visuals** directly from prompts.
- It opens up possibilities for **creative tools, design automation**, and **AI-assisted content generation**.
- Disabling watermarks (`add_watermark=False`) allows for clean output for internal testing.
- Using a consistent seed helps in producing reproducible outputs for testing or tuning.
